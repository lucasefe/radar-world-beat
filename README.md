# radar-world-beat

Just another radar sample project, using presence, and faking activity from many clients and servers. 

## Usage

    npm install 
    
    nf start
    
    open http://localhost:8080/
    

On another window run another server

	node server --port 8002

And another client

	RADAR_PORT=8002 node client

Open your browser

	open http://localhost:8000

Now just let them run for a while You should see a map with markers of three different colors popping in and out.

After a few seconds, say 30, kill the server process running on port 8002 (it's the one you started second).

After waiting, you should see a bunch of markers (marked with R letter) go away. That's the client_offline events generated by the other servers after detecting server 8002 not being there for a while. 

Enjoy!
