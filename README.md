# radar-world-beat

Just another radar sample project, using presence, and faking activity from many clients and servers.

NOTE: This is just an example, and it's not really a useful project. 

## Installation

    npm install 

Install forman (globally) foreman, if you don't have it. 

    npm install -g foreman

## Usage

Run node foreman to start a few processes at the same time:

    nf start    

On another window run one extra server

	node server --port 8002

And another client manager. The client manager is relly a client generator, generating fake activity on a given server. 

	RADAR_PORT=8002 node client

Open your browser

    open http://localhost:8080/    

Now just let them run for a while You should see a map with markers of three different colors popping in and out.

After a few seconds, say 30, kill the server process running on port 8002 (it's the one you started second).

After waiting, you should see a bunch of markers (with an R) go away. Those are the client_offline events generated by the other servers after detecting server 8002 not being there for a while. 

Enjoy!
